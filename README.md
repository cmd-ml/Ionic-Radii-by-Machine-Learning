Extending Shannon's ionic radii database using machine learning

In computational material design, ionic radius is one of the most important physical parameters used to predict material properties. Motivated by the progress in computational materials science and material informatics, we extend the renowned Shannon's table from 475 ions to 987 ions. Accordingly, a rigorous machine learning (ML) approach is employed to extend the ionic radii table using all possible combinations of oxidation states (OS) and coordination numbers (CN) available in crystallographic repositories.
